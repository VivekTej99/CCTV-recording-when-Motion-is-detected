# CCTV-recording-when-Motion-is-detected
Nowadays we see, all the cctvs' will record and save 24 hrs' footage, in which 80% is unwanted footage (i.e 80% of the footage contains no person passing by, and that footage is no use for us) and rest 20% footage is only useful (i.e 20% footage contains persons passing by and wanted details). Thus , this 80% leads to the wastage of hard-disk's memory. So, my project is to save hard-disks' memory. 
Thus we can record and save only that 20% footage and couldn't record that 80% unwanted footage.
This project is purely based on motion detection capturing.
